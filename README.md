# advent-of-code-2022
Advent of code 2022 in Rust (at least, the ones I actually did)

## Running

The project is structured as a single executable.
By using clap, it can be run with different args for different days and inputs.

The output is printed to stdout.

E.g. To run day 1 in release mode (faster) `cargo run --release -- --day 1 input.txt`
